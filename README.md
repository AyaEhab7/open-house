## About

This module is all about building a robust MEN (MongoDB, Express.js, Node.js) stack application. We'll be creating "OpenHouse," a real estate app that allows users to keep track of and favorite property listings. Throughout this code-along, youâ€™ll learn about referencing related data within user models using Mongoose and MongoDB. Additionally, this module guides you through styling your application, helping you create a polished, portfolio-worthy project. Designed for intermediate learners with a background in full-stack JavaScript development, "OpenHouse" offers practical experience in managing data relationships in full stack web applications.
